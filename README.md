# Little work with pandas ,csv files and matploplib
This is a little piece of my code, 
mainly the code do:
Take a csv file to pd and work with creating different columns
Calculate different columns values
Make some boxplot.
If you check 'Variables_lite.py' you can check some other formulas that
I use for the 'full' code in wich I work with url, os, pickle and make 
more complex analysis.
